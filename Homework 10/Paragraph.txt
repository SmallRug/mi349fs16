For me personally, I found it easiest to create a full blown comp. When I was designing for the comp, I found it much easier to actually lay all of my ideas on the page than rather have them merely represented by a few colors, fonts and adjectives. I spent about six hours on this project. From figuring my away around Photoshop, to creating each of the tiles, to finally putting together a comp. Nonetheless, actually being able to see how the end product looks as I was constructing it, I really felt much more connected and was able to make real time changes to what the web page will actually look like, allowing me to see weather the design I envisioned in my head was really feasible or not.
