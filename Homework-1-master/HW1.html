        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <h3>Jokes</h3>
        <p>I apparently tell bad jokes. I think they're funny, but my friends disagree.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Guitar</h3>
        <p>I also like to play guitar in my spare time, I've been playing for about a year now and I think it's good fun and very relaxing to play before I go to bed.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>I just take shots on my iPhone whenever I travel, but it's something I greatly enjoy doing.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I like to program in Python and C# every once in a while, it's not something I do often, but a good way to pass the time every once in a while.</p>
